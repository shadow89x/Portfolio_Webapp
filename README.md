## 🔍 Vector Search Feature

### Overview
The Vector Search feature is an AI-powered similarity search system that allows users to find similar products using either text queries or image URLs. It leverages Azure Computer Vision's vectorization capabilities to create embeddings and perform cosine similarity searches.

### Features
- **Text Search**: Enter descriptive text (e.g., "robot", "car", "toy") to find similar products
- **Image Search**: Provide image URLs to find visually similar products
- **Real-time Results**: Instant search results with similarity scores
- **Fallback Mode**: Works offline with sample data when API is unavailable
- **EXP Integration**: Gain EXP for successful searches

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern UI design
- **AI Service**: Azure Computer Vision API for vectorization
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for vector comparison
- **Local Storage**: Persistent Azure credentials and search history

### Setup Instructions
1. **Configure Azure credentials** (optional):
   Enter your Azure Computer Vision credentials in the web interface:
   - Azure Endpoint: `https://your-resource-name.cognitiveservices.azure.com`
   - Azure API Key: Your subscription key

2. **Access the feature**:
   Navigate to the Vector Search page via the sidebar link
   Enter text or image URLs to search for similar products

### Security Notes
- Azure credentials are stored in browser localStorage
- API includes error handling and fallback mechanisms
- No server-side storage of sensitive data
